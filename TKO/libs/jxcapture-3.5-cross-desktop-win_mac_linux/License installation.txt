Installing Licence Files

--------------------------
The JxCapture library requires valid licence files: jxcapture.lic and jniwrap.lic.

If you had purchased the product, the licence files were sent to you by email.

If you are evaluating our product, you need an evaluation licence. To get the evaluation licence 
please complete the following steps:
	- click the "Evaluate now" button on the product page (http://www.teamdev.com/jxcapture/); 
	- fill your name and email in the evaluation form;

Licence files have to be installed in the same directory as the native code library or in 
the META-INF subfolder of any jar library from the  application's classpath.

Do NOT rename licence files or they will not be recognized.
